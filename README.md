# Slender Row
There are squares on the screen. Clicking on any of them changes the order: horizontal -> diagonal -> horizontal.

- The changes are animated.
- Works for any number of squares.
- The squares do not go beyond the Safe Area, but take up all the available space. For horizontal, they fit in width, for diagonal, they fit in height.
