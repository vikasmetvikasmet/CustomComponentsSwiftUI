# Droplet

Two circles on top of each other. The top circle has a cloud.sun.rain.fill icon and can be moved around the screen.

- The circle is pulled out from the bottom circle like a droplet.
- When we release the circle, it returns to the center with inertia.
- The circle in the center is yellow, and the one that was pulled out is red.
